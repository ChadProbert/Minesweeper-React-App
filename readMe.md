# Minesweeper React App

## Description

This is a React App that I built for one of my Capstone Projects through HyperionDev's Full Stack Web Development Course.

## Rules & Instructions

1. Click "START GAME" to play the game
2. Use mouse left-click button on any of the tiles to reveal what is underneath
3. If you reveal a mine, you lose and will have to click "RESTART" to start a new game
4. Use mouse right-click to flag a tile as a potential mine
5. Use the clues displayed as numbers underneath revealed tiles to understand where the mines are placed
6. The number underneath a revealed tile informs the player how many mines are surrounding that tile
7. If you successfully reveal all the tiles without revealing any of the 10 randomly placed mines then you will have won the game
